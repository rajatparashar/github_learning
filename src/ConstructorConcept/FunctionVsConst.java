		//4. calling: const.. will be called when you create the object but function will be called using obj ref variable
		//5. overloading: both const../function can be overloaded with the same rule
		//6. const... will helping to initialize the class instance(gloab) variable from the local variable using this keyword
		//7. const.. will never be used to write the buss.. logic because it will be called when you create the object
		//and const.. will never return anything.
		//function should have the buss logic and return accordingly....
